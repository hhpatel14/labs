On the right, you will see two split terminals. We will generally use the lower terminal for most executions while upper terminal will be reserved for reviewing yaml files and watching result of executions.

There are two types of lab buttons you will find in this lab.

- The first two below are execute buttons which will send commands to either the upper or lower terminal.
- The third is a command copy button. It will be used for copying content to be pasted later.

Try the execute buttons
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
echo upper terminal
----
[source,bash,role=execute-2]
----
echo lower terminal
----
[source,bash,role=copy]
----
echo copy
----

You copy `kubeadmin` password here if you need it.
[source,bash,role=copy]
----
%ocp4_password%
----

In the next lab, we will be using the buttons above to login as kubeadmin on the terminal.
