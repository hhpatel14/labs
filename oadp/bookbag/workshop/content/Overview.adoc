The OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) is an Operator that helps you define and configure installation of https://velero.io/[Velero] and its required resources to run on OpenShift.

OADP enables backup, restore, and disaster recovery of an OpenShift cluster. Data that can be protected with OADP include k8s resource objects, persistent volumes, and internal images.
The OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) is designed to protect Application Workloads on the same OpenShift cluster.

If you want to migrate data between clusters, please look into the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.8/html/migration_toolkit_for_containers[Migration Toolkit for Containers project (MTC)].

=== Architecture

/** OADP Architecture */

IMPORTANT: `cluster-admin` role is currently required to use OADP. +

=== Provided APIs
OADP allow several https://velero.io/docs/v1.7/api-types/[Velero API types] to be configured and defined within a single Custom Resource YAML.
The most up to date API reference for OADP is located on the https://github.com/openshift/oadp-operator/blob/master/docs/API_ref.md[openshift/oadp-operator] repository

We are providing a copy below for convenience.
