== Backing up single namespace - CSI Volume Snapshotting

We will be protecting a Todo List web-based application front-end that is backed by MariaDB Server. This application has already been deployed on your OCP 4 cluster in the `mysql-persistent` namespace. In the terminal of our source OCP 4 cluster, we can observe the application running.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -n mysql-persistent
----

[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                     READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE

Let's obtain the route to the application and access the web UI.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get route -n mysql-persistent

NOTE: You can also click http://todolist-route-mysql-persistent.{APPS_URL}[here] to open the application.

Letâ€™s add a new activity to the todo-list. Click on the (+) `Add button` on the upper right corner to enter some data.

You can see the application is functioning and activity is being saved in the DB.

=== Using Velero to backup application namespace

Let's proceed with creating a backup of the `mysql-persistent` namespace.
[source,bash,role=execute-2]
----
velero backup create mysql-backup --include-namespaces mysql-persistent
----

You can monitor the progress of the backup by executing the following command.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
velero backup describe mysql-backup
----

When the backup `Phase:` is `Completed`, proceed to the next section.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
velero backup describe mysql-backup | grep Phase:
----

=== Viewing backup content in S3 storage
Backup content is stored in S3 storage in the specified content in the prefix location under folder backup inside the backup name's folder.

`<bucket>/<velero-prefix>/backups/<backup-name>/<backup-content>`

Note: awsocs is an alias of `awsocs='aws --endpoint-url http://s3.openshift-storage.svc'`
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
awsocs s3 ls migstorage/velero/backups/mysql-backup/
----

Content on these files are explained in https://velero.io/docs/v1.7/output-file-format/[Velero Docs].

=== Backing up persistent volumes
Velero have several options to backup persistent volumes. The original capabilities from the start are to use https://github.com/restic/restic[restic] or a cloud provider's native volume snapshot capability. Velero have since added Container Storage Interface (CSI) support to backup persistent volumes.
CSI is an interface for storage introduced to Kubernetes to support many storage solutions. You can use CSI interface with any cloud provider who has implemented it.

As CSI is the preferred interface in Kubernetes, this lab has been designed to use CSI for storage.

=== About Velero CSI Snapshot with OpenShift Data Foundation
In order to use CSI with velero, feature flag `EnableCSI` and plugin `csi` is required. It is specified in our DataProtectionApplication Custom Resource.

You can look at the velero configuration by running the following command:
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get dpa example-dpa -n openshift-adp -o=jsonpath="{.spec.configuration.velero}" && echo
----
Aside from enabling CSI from Velero side, the volume that is going to be backed up must be using a CSI driver. A VolumeSnapshotClass object is also needed and has to specify the CSI driver along with the following label `velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class: 'true'`.

See the storage class used by the application in the following command:
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get pvc -n mysql-persistent
----

This storage class has provisioner `ebs.csi.aws.com`
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get storageclass gp2-csi
----

which is one of the CSI driver installed on the system
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get csidrivers
----

We have added `velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class: 'true'` label to a VolumeSnapshotClass object for the `ebs.csi.aws.com` driver which were used by the application we had just backed up.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get VolumeSnapshotClass oadp-example-snapclass -ojsonpath='{.metadata.labels}' && echo
----

Since the persistent volume specified in backup is using a CSI driver with the label, a volume snapshot was taken.

NOTE: volumeSnapshot is immediately deleted after backup marks complete.

View VolumeSnapshot taken till the backup is `InProgress` stage
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
 oc get volumesnapshot -n mysql-persistent
----

View VolumeSnapshotContent created.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get volumesnapshotcontent
----

CSI Snapshot is local to the cluster. However, a DataMover capability in exercise III will allow snapshot moving to an external location.

 Volumesnapshots created by the plugin will be retained only for the lifetime of the backup even if the DeletionPolicy on the volumesnapshotclass is set to Retain. To accomplish this, during deletion of the backup the prior to deleting the volumesnapshot, volumesnapshotcontent object will be patched to set its DeletionPolicy to Delete. Thus deleting volumesnapshot object will result in cascade delete of the volumesnapshotcontent and the snapshot in the storage provider.

For more information about how CSI plugin works, see https://velero.io/docs/v1.7/csi/#how-it-works---overview[Velero Docs].

We have set DeletionPolicy of Retain on the VolumeSnapshotClass to preserve the volume snapshot in the storage system for the lifetime of the Velero backup and prevent the deletion of the volume snapshot, in the storage system, in the event of a disaster where the namespace with the VolumeSnapshot object may be lost. We will attempt to create this disaster scenario in the next section.


=== Simulate a disaster
When the backup `Phase:` is `Completed`, we'll proceed to simulate a disaster by deleting the namespace.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc delete ns mysql-persistent
----

Check that the application is no longer available.

NOTE: Click http://todolist-route-mysql-persistent.{APPS_URL}[here] to open the application.

When application is no longer available, proceed to next section.

=== Restoring deleted application
We can restore applications deleted earlier by restoring from the backup we created.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
velero restore create mysql-restore --from-backup mysql-backup
----

We can check when the restore is completed by running the following. The restore is complete when `Phase:` is `Completed`.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
velero restore describe mysql-restore && velero restore describe mysql-restore | grep Phase:
----

Wait until pods become available.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -n mysql-persistent
----

[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]

Verify that the data you added earlier persisted in the restored application.
