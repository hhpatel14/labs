== OpenShift Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) Lab

=== Migrating from OCP 3.x to OCP 4.x

This guide will provide you with hands-on exposure to the OpenShift Migration +
Tooling through a series of exercises migrating application workloads (both +
stateful and stateless) between OpenShift Clusters.

=== Goals

In this instructor-led, hands-on lab, youâ€™ll experience:

* Migrating applications from Red Hat OpenShift 3 clusters to Red Hat OpenShift +
4 clusters using the Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) provided by OpenShift +
Container Platform 4 leveraging both the UI and API.

* Use cases that migrate applications preserving state, including how to migrate +
OpenShift Container Storage 3 (Gluster) to OpenShift Container Storage 4 (Ceph).

* Tips, techniques, and best-practices for debugging failed migrations.
