*Congratulations* and *Thank You* for participating in the OpenShift Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) Lab. We hope you have found it to be both informative and thorough. By now you have completed the following activities:

* Familiarized yourself with the MTC WebUI
* Migrated multiple applications (stateless and stateful) from OpenShift 3 to OpenShift 4
* Performed both Copy and Move operations for handling Persistent Volumes
* Leveraged the API to migrate multiple namespaces in a single Migration Plan

Weâ€™ve included a couple of additional applications in the 3.11 cluster deployment (Parks App, Robot Shop & Rocket-Chat). Feel Free to perform migrations of these applications too (time permitting).
